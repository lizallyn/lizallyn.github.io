Liz is most interested in doing science to inform equitable resource management. She currently works at the Coast Salmon Partnership as a Salmon Recovery Coordinator. Her work is focused on building momentum for Lake Ozette Sockeye salmon recovery. 

She has a Master’s in Aquatic and Fishery Sciences from the University of Washington, where she worked with western Washington treaty tribes to explore tribal pinniped management options to support salmon recovery in Puget Sound. 

Liz previously spent 6+ years with the Makah Tribe researching marine mammals to support treaty rights, which mostly included following whales around in boats, scooping sea lion poop, deploying plankton nets, and mentoring tribal youth in some of the most beautiful scenery Washington has to offer. Liz loves working at the intersection of science and policy and will talk your ear off about community-driven research and treaty resource management.   

When she’s not working, she’s probably working on her boat, buying supplies for a boat project, or maybe even sailing! She may also be found hiking, diving, reading, biking, and drinking copious amounts of tea.
