### Who Am I?
Liz is most interested in doing science to inform equitable resource management. Her thesis research is currently focused on evaluating management actions to address pinniped predation on salmon in Puget Sound in collaboration with Puget Sound tribes.  
At her day job as the Marine Mammal Technician for the Makah Tribe, Liz enjoys following whales around in boats, scooping sea lion poop, and deploying plankton nets in some of the most beautiful scenery Washington has to offer. Liz loves working at the intersection of science and policy and will talk your ear off about community-driven research and treaty resource management.  
When she’s not working, she’s probably working on her boat, buying supplies for a boat project, or maybe even sailing! She may also be found hiking, diving, reading, biking, and drinking copious amounts of tea.
