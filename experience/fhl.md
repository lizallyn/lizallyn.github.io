subtitle: A Quarter of Hands-On Science at FHL

In Fall 2016 I was lucky to spend a quarter at Friday Harbor Labs on San Juan Island, WA. I studies fish biology and taxonomy, oceanography, and took a hands-on marine research class. In the research class we designed and carried out research projects on eelgrass transplantation and restoration. Our project focused on figuring out whether tide height matters for eelgrass transplantation success - either on the donor or recipient end.

### Does Tide Height Matter for Eelgrass Transplantation Success?

During that quarter I also volunteered at the Whale Museum and was primarily tasked with scanning archived killer whale identification photo negatives to ensure their safe digital storage.
