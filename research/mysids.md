### Can Monitoring Gray Whale Prey Help Us Understand Their Distribution?  

The distribution of gray whales throughout NW Washington is highly spatially and temporally variable. We've been conducting prey sampling using a bongo-style plankton net since 2019 at discrete foraging locations within our research area to monitor the prey base available to gray whales and help us understand one of the potential underlying factors determining their distribution.

We published a paper in 2024 that explored the patterns of co-occurrence between feeding gray whales and concentrations of one of their important prey items - mysid shrimp. We look forward to continuing to collect and analyze this data in order to explore more concrete relationships between gray whales and their prey and link this information to their distribution throughout the wider Pacific Coast Feeding Group range.

The underlying plankton tow data is published on Mendeley Data [here](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/xpsgkxdnwk/1).

### Gray Whale Population Monitoring

I also assist with regular surveys of the Makah U&A to assess gray whale population abundance, movement, and survival. We photograph individuals for mark-recapture analyses; document body condition; collect biopsy samples for genetics, contaminants, and hormone analyses; and collect fecal samples for HABs detection. I conduct all types of sample collection, operate the research vessel, and am a named co-investigator on our permits.
