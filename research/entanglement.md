### Abundance and Entanglement

#### *What is the status of sea lions on the coast of NW Washington State?*

We conduct regular small boat surveys of the NW Washington Coast year-round to monitor use of four major haulout sites. We record counts, species and demographic composition, brand resights, entanglements, and any other interesting observations. This data is used to help us understand sea lion site use in this region and the differences between the two species (Steller and California sea lions). 

In 2020 we published a paper reporting trends in haulout abundance and entanglement occurrence for both species from 2010 - 2018. The published article is available open access [here](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0237178).


### Diet

#### *What is the impact of Steller sea lion consumption on salmon?*

During surveys of the coast we also collect scat samples for diet and genetic analysis. While we primarily target Steller sea lions for regular scat collection efforts, we have also focused on harbor seal diet, though this proved extremely challenging. Processing of scats and analysis of the implications was conducted by Zoe Lewis during her Master's at Western Washington University. 

A paper describing harbor seal diet based on our scat collection is available [here](https://bioone.org/journals/northwestern-naturalist/volume-104/issue-3/NWN22-17/FIRST-DIET-DESCRIPTION-OF-THE-HARBOR-SEAL-PHOCA-VITULINA-IN/10.1898/NWN22-17.short).

Papers based on the Steller sea lion diet work are in preparation or in review and will hopefully be available soon. Zoe's thesis can be accessed [here](https://faculty.aceveda.wwu.edu/PDFs/theses/Lewis%20thesis.pdf).
